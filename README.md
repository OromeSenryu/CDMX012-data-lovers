# Data Lovers Project - Choose Your Champion

## About the project

Choose Your Champion is designed as a web page for showing League of Legends' champion database, as well as specific information like role, abilities, type, and their statistics about attack and defense matters.

***

## Targets and User Experience

We defined three specific targets for UX design and functions all over the page:

* Low-frequency users, who wants to to know about the role and difficulty of any champion for playing them on the rift.
* Mid-frequency users, interested on filter tools for ordering champions by their attack on first level and consider that information for picking a character and/or taking better decisions during early battles.
* Competitive users, who asked for a filter tool that could order champions by their base defense, bringing them information for choosing a character with major posibilities for an agressive early game.

## Prototype

We decided to take a first-step for design creating sketches by hand, in order to get a better "big picture" for our high-fidelity prototype

And then, start dreaming big about that prototype

... Well, kinda too big, maybe. We had to let go some of the function and design features for now, in order to cover all of our learning objectives and show a finished product.
Here's our result:
